<h1>Photos from the LIGO Hanford Observatory</h1>
<br>

The LIGO Hanford Observatory (LHO) in Hanford, WA is one of two observatories operated by LIGO--the other one is Livingston, LA. &nbsp;
LHO has two interferometers, one with 4&nbsp;km arms (H1) and a smaller 2&nbsp;km interferometer (H2).
Gravitational waves change the relative lengths of each arm by tiny amounts corresponding to strains &lt;&nbsp;O(10<sup>-22</sup>)&nbsp;Hz<sup>-1/2</sup>.
We deduce these strains by measuring the light emitted from the interferometers' dark port.

In this photo I'm working in the HAM&nbsp;6 chamber, which houses the output mode cleaner (OMC)--one of the new features of Enhanced LIGO. &nbsp;
(The OMC is housed in the metal cage in front of me.) &nbsp;
During normal operation this chamber is kept in vacuum. &nbsp;
While in the chamber we wear clean suits to minimize detritus, which can adversely affect the sensitive optics.

This photo shows the OMC from a different angle. &nbsp;
The component by my left hand is one of the "tip-tilt" mirrors, TT2.
