<h3>TeamSpeak Best Practices</h3>
<li> <b>Wear headphones.</b> 
TeamSpeak does not have the echo-canceling technology of Zoom.
Headphones are therefore <i>essential</i> to prevent echoes.
If you don't have headhphones for some reason, make sure to mute yourself immediately once you've stopped speaking.
<li> <b>Mute yourself.</b>
Even if you're wearing headphones, make sure to mute yourself when you're not speaking so that the other attendees do not hear ambient noise in your room, breathing, etc.
<li> <b>Include page numbers.</b>
Since zoom does not enable you to share your screen, it is essential that you provide page numbers so listeners know where you are.
<li> <b>Say when you're going on to the next page.</b>
Since there is no video, it is essential that you say, for example, "moving on to page 13," when you changes pages.
Otherwise, your audience will be totally lost.
