<h1 align="center">Monash University: Financial Reports</h1>
<br>

This page contains tips for balancing a Monash budget and interpreting financial reports.
First, I recommend scheduling regular in-person meetings with someone from the finance team.<br><br>

<b>Fund Balance.</b>
Upon request, Finance will send you a "Fund Balance" document, which is not part of your regular Report.<br>
<img src="/web/20240408191852im_/https://users.monash.edu.au/~erict/Resources/Monash/balances.png"><br>
The report shows the finances as of some preparation date.
The fund balnce lists your active revenue sources.
The last column is the net balance; <b>negative means that you have money to spend</b>.
<b>Money in Future Fellowships rolls over for the next year</b>; I assume this is also true of Discovery Projects.
In addition to the money that rolls over, <b>there is a new contribution each year, e.g., $9500</b>.
If you have start-up, or something else that you are using to pay a postdoc, the money in net balance <i>does not</i> include commitments to pay your postdoc.
<br><br>

<b>Fund Owner Summary.</b>
This page is the front of your financial report.
It has a <i>different sign convention</i> from the "Fund Balance" document: positive is good, negative is bad.<br>
<img src="/web/20240408191852im_/https://users.monash.edu.au/~erict/Resources/Monash/summary.png"><br>
The front page includes a "project end forecast balnce" column, which <i>does</i> include salary commitments, e.g., to postdocs...at least, this is true for the start-up fund; the FT salary fund does not appear to deduct commitments (everything).
This is the key thing to look at to know what you have left over after salaries.
<br><br>

<b>Details by fund.</b>
In order to see what you're spending on travel and on salaries--or to see what you have paid so far toward some salary commitment--turn to the "Detailed P and L by Fund" page.
There is a different page for each fund.
<br>
<img src="/web/20240408191852im_/https://users.monash.edu.au/~erict/Resources/Monash/details.png"><br>
Postdoc salaries are in the row labeled "Academic."
Undergraduates are listed under "Casual and Sessional."
There are also rows for "travel" and "infrastructure," which includes things like computers.
<br><br>

<b>Additional transaction details</b> are included below if you ever want to find out exactly how money was spent, item by item.<br><br>


<h3>Other Tips</h3>

<b>Future fellowships.</b> 
If you have a Future Fellowship, do not charge any purchases to the "Salary Fund," use the "Project Fund."<br><br>

<b>Non-compliant expenses:</b> visas for relocation (not allowed in an FT, but are allowed in a COE), entertainment, membership fees, more than one laptop per two years (FT).<br><br>
