<b>Panopto</b><pre>
For Panopto first thing that had to happen was our units needed to "be provisioned" (link set up between moodle and panopto). I have now provisioned both units so no need to worry about this (I can tell you the details if you need them).

NOTE: you must log out of moodle and log back in to see newly provisioned units.

Next step is getting into panopto proper:
1. go to https://monash-panopto.aarnet.edu.au/
2. sign in, using authcate

Next navigate to the moodle generated panopto folder:
1. on the left list click Browse
Click on "Moodle"
2. scroll down and find PHS1011

To add content:
1. Click create.
2. Select upload media from the drop down menu
3. As per the instructions there either drag and drop media files into the area in the panopto window, or click the area to open a file browser and find and select your media.
Following the upload, click on the background screen.
This initiates a necessary "processing" step.

Since the moodle is linked to panopto the system should now automatically enable people in the unit to view (or lecturers to add or edit or remove) media.

Note that students won't be able to access panopto links without first logging into moodle, so be sure to note this when including links.


TO MOVE CONTENT FROM LAST YEAR:
0. log on to https://monash-panopto.aarnet.edu.au/ with okta account
1. Navigate to your videos, e.g., in My Folder or by searching for a previous PHS1011 folder.
2. Select videos you want to copy.
3. Click the "move" button.

<h3>Setting up a new moodle page</h3>
1. Contact Lisa to request a new page.<br>
2. Turn on editing, click on "Administration" on the RHS, click on "Users," click on "Enrolled Users," enrol members as Lecturers.<br>
3. Edit section names: Click on the cog symbol below the current topic name (turn editing on to see this, when you mouse over it says "edit summary"
Untick the box which says "use default section name", then you can type a new section name.<br>
4. Remove sections: If the topic you want to delete is not already the last topic: Click on the move icon to the upper left of the topic name and move it to be the last topic. Alternatively click and hold the move icon, and drag it until it is the last topic
If the topic you want to delete has content in it, delete all the content individually.
Go to Administration -&gt; Unit Adminstration -&gt; Edit Settings
In "Unit Appearance", reduce the number of topics. If you reduce by one, it will delete the last topic.
I know this is a ridiculous way of deleting topics, currently the only documented way of doing so. If you reduce the number of topics without deleting all content from the last topic, the content in that deleted topic will appear as "Orphaned items", in a list below the last topic. They may not appear immediately, but will do so eventually. You can then move them elsewhere or delete them.<br>
5. Adding topics: Go to Administration -&gt; Unit Adminstration -&gt; Edit Settings
In "Unit Appearance", increase the number of topics. This will add new topics after current existing topics. You can then reorder them using the move icon.
Whenever you move, delete, or add a topic, Moodle may then display the wrong topic names. Refresh the page to fix this.<br>

<h2>Travel and Finances</h2>

<h3>Coupa</h3><br>
Coupa is a system by which you can obtain a "virtual credit card" to pay for a one-time expense.
It is required when your credit card is maxed out or when you are purchasing something that exceeds your credit limit.
You submit a request for this virtual credit card which requires an invoice, fund numbers, details about the expense, etc.
You wait while the finance team decides whether or not to approve the purchase.
If they do, they send you the virtual credit card numbers, which you can then juse to make the purchase in the same way that you would with a normal credit card.
This virtual credit card can only be used once, and it can only be used for the the thing you got approval for.
Then, you file a claim with concur the way you normally would.
In sum, it coupa is a complicated way to get a virtual credit card when your regular credit card is not up to the job.<br><br>

If you are buying something for the first time, you'll need to register first <a href="https://www.intranet.monash/finance/our-services/coupa">here</a>.
