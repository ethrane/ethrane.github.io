<h1 align="center">C++ Template</h1>

<p>
<br>
To compile "Executable"--the executable described in this code--use the command: "make". 
Use the command "make clean" to remove .o files.
<br><br>

MathTools.cpp contains sources code for useful mathematical tools.
It is under construction.
<br><br>

Template.cpp contains the main() function.
This is what gets called when you run your executable.
You have to call your main function "main()", otherwise the compiler doesn't understand what to do.
Notice that main() is a function of type integer.
Also notice that it returns a value of 0 at the end of the code.
main() must be an integer function.
The fact that it returns 0 is conventional.
It can, in principle, return something else, but this is only used for esoteric diagnostic processes.
<br><br>

Notice the main() function takes arguments argc and *argv[].
If you run the executable on the command line, you may follow the command with special modifiers.  For example:
</p>
<ul>
./Executable inputfile outputfile 300 ...
</ul>
<p>
Maybe this command is telling your executable to read in "inputfile", do 300 years of Monte Carlo, then output the results to "outputfile"
When you run Executable, the integer argc is set equal to the number of modifiers you include...in this case, argc=3.
argv[1] is set to "inputfile" in this case because that is the first modifier.
Here, argv[2] is set to "outputfile" and argv[3] is set to 300.
The argv[] array is handy because it accepts strings and numbers.
Then you can refer to these objects in your code...
but only if you include argc and *argv[] as arguments of your main function!
You should include them always by habit so they're there if you need them.
<br><br>
The #include &lt;something&gt; statements at the beginning of the code tell the compiler what code in the standard C++ library you'll be referencing in your main(). 
To be safe, include all the <bracketed> include files in the template.
&lt;iostream&gt; handles functions like cin and cout.
&lt;fstream&gt; lets you read in data from files using ifstream.
&lt;math.h&gt; knows about a bunch of common functions:
</p>
<ul><h6>
double acos(double); <br>
double asin(double); <br>
double atan(double); <br>
double atan2(double, double); <br>
double ceil(double); <br>

double acosh(double); <br>
double asinh(double); <br>
double atanh(double); <br>
double cbrt(double); <br>
double expm1(double); <br>
int    ilogb(double); <br>
double log1p(double); <br>
double logb(double); <br>
double nextafter(double, double); <br>
double remainder(double, double); <br>
double rint(double); <br>
double scalb(double, doub le); <br>
</h6>
</ul>
<p>
Most of the functions have self-explanatory names.
I'll try to add explanations of less obvious ones later.
<br><br>
The #include "MathTools.h" statement includes source code that I have written myself in files MathTools.h and MathTools.cpp.
Notice, that "MathTools.h" is in double-quotes and not brackets.
That is because it is code that is not in the standard C++ library.
Rather, I have added it myself.
<br><br>
The "using namespace std;" line tells the compiler that when you use common functions like "cout" and "endl", you mean what we usually mean when we call those functions.
If you want the function "cout" to do something weird like print "Duh!" to the screen every time it's called, you can create a different namespace, and define "cout" to be something different.
Usually, one uses the standard namespace.
