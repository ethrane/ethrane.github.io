<b>Importing python packages with a virtual environment:</b>
Many users use a virtual environment in order to be able to import specific verseions of things like Bilby.
In order for your jupyter notebook to use this environment, you may need to adjust the kernel: Kernel &gt; Change kernel &gt; Select kernel &gt; igwn-py39.
Sometimes if you are having a problem with importing some python package, you might need to restart the kernel entirely.
Then try again, e.g., to run pip3 before importing.
