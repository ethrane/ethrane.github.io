<br>
Autodesk Inventor is a nice program for designing parts.&nbsp;
You can use it to make 3D models as well as 2D drawings. <br><br>

<b>Create a new part:</b> open a .ipt file.
This file contains 3D information about the part that you can use to create a separate .dwg drawing file. <br>
<b>To switch from <i>sketch</i> to <i>feature</i> environment:</b> ctrl-+ <br>
<b>To adjust the dimension of a part:</b> use the sketch environment. <br>
If a part, say a disc, has been extruded, you need to click on the Sketch (e.g., Extrusion1/Sketch1) for the original disc in order to modify the diameter. <br>

<b>Drilling multiple holes symmetrically around an axis:</b><br>
Right click on the sketch and select <i>share sketch</i> in the feature environment. <br>
This will make things like circles accessible in the feature environment. <br>
Specify the first hole by placing a circle on the sketch. <br>
(The size of the circle does not matter.) <br>
You may need to click on the <i>Terminations</i> icon (square with black and red arrows coming out of it) if you try to drill the wrong way through your part.<br>
Then click on the circular symmetry tool. <br>
First select the feature you want to replicate (the hole). <br>
Then select the axis of symmetry by clicking on the original circle. <br>
Select how many holes you want to appear and space them out over 360 degrees.
<br><br>

<b>To make a 2D drawing from a 3D part:</b> open a new .dwg file.<br>
Click on <i>base view</i> and place the part on the sheet.<br>
<b>Center lines:</b> Right-click on object and select <i>automated center lines</i>.<br>
Then click on all the little icons.<br>
More options under <b>drawing annotation panel</b>.
<br><br>

<b>change the scale:</b> move cursor over part until the part is highlighted in a dotted-line box.  Right-click and select <i>Edit view</i>.  Then select <i>Scale</i>.
<br><br>

<b>drill a hole on the extruded side of a part:</b> click on the face you want to drill on. &nbsp; Then click "Sketch" in the upper panel to start a new sketch for that face. <br><br>
