<b>installing bilby and bilby_pipe:</b>
Personally, I found installing bilby and bilby_pipe with pip to be very difficult.
My student encountered a lot of problems with python/pip version issues that we were unable to sort out.
Fortunately, we were able to work around that using these <a href="https://lscsoft.docs.ligo.org/bilby_pipe/master/installation.html#python-installation">instructions</a> for conda installation.
The key commands are:
<pre>
conda create -n bilby python=3.9
conda activate bilby
pip install --upgrade git+file://${HOME}/bilby_pipe
</pre>

These commands will upgrade to python3.9: ~/.conda/envs/bilby/bin/python. Pip also gets updated.
After that,
<pre>
source /cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/ligo/sw/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
conda activate igwn-py39
</pre>
Now your bilby_pipe should be installed:
<pre>
(igwn-py39) -bash-4.2$ which bilby_pipe
/cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/ligo/sw/conda/envs/igwn-py39/bin/bilby_pipe
(igwn-py39) -bash-4.2$ bilby_pipe --version
bilby_pipe=1.0.6: (CLEAN) 76a4ef2 2022-04-26 12:39:06 +0100 bilby=1.1.5:
</pre>
Put the following commands in your .bash_login:
<pre>
alias python='~/.conda/envs/bilby/bin/python'
alias pip='~/.conda/envs/bilby/bin/pip'
alias bilby_pipe='/cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/ligo/sw/conda/envs/igwn-py39/bin/bilby_pipe'
</pre>
