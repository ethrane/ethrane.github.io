<b>Getting started with GWPopulation:</b><pre>
Provided an already working local installation of anaconda, I needed to create a conda environment following instructions here. For an environment named 'cenv' (this name can be anything), this is done with conda create --name cenv.
The environment is then activated with conda activate cenv.
I could then install cupy via conda-forge using conda install -c conda-forge cupy as per this page.
I also had to reinstall all of the usual packages on this environment like numpy, scipy, etc. most of which were automatically installed as dependencies when installing cupy. This could be done using the usual pip install <package> method.
