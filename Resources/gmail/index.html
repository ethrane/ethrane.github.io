<h2>Hack your gmail</h2>

<b>Set up filters to sort mail without missing something important</b><br>
1. Create a new label called AAA.
This label will serve as a second inbox of sorts.
Create other labels for mail that you want to keep, but that you don't want cluttering your inbox.
This may include mail sent to your email address and/or mail sent to important lists that you're on.<br><br>

2. Set up filters to make sure that all important email is labeled AAA.
Do not Mark as Read and do not Skip Inbox.
To create a new filter, click on the little gear icon on the top-right.
Click "Settings&gt;Filters and Blocked Addresses."<br><br>

3. Set up other filters to send clutter-mail to appropriate labels.
Do not Mark as Read but do Skip Inbox.
Now if you get a piece of mail sent to you <i>and</i> sent to some list that you generally want to ignore, the mail will be saved in AAA, even though it's removed from your inbox.
On the other hand, if you get mail from some clutter-list, but it is not sent to anything flagged for AAA, it will not be saved to AAA.<br><br>

4. To view your (important) unread mail, type "label:aaa is:unread" in the search window.
To view all important mail, type label:aaa.<br><br>

5. Periodically, compare your Inbox with label:aaa.
They should be mostly the same except for the occasional email sent to you <i>and</i> a clutter-mail list, which is gone from the inbox, but rescued by AAA.
Or, if you are on a mailing list that you forgot about, mail could end up in Inbox but not AAA.
<br><br>

6. Check through your clutter-mail labels periodically to make sure you're flagging everything for AAA that you want to flag.
